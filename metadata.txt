about=The ANN Landslide Susceptibility plugin allows QGIS users to generate landslide susceptibility maps directly within the QGIS environment using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The plugin takes raster predictor layers (e.g., elevation, slope, lithology, distance to rivers/roads) as inputs, processes them into a consistent stack, and applies the ANN model to produce a susceptibility raster. This output highlights areas with varying levels of landslide risk, helping researchers, planners, and decision-makers integrate susceptibility analysis into their spatial workflows without leaving QGIS.
