qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Creates landslide susceptibility maps using trained Artificial Neural Networks
version=1.0
author=Anees Omar
email=aneesomar.ao@gmail.com

about=The ANN Landslide Susceptibility plugin allows QGIS users to generate landslide susceptibility maps using a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network model. The plugin processes multiple raster input layers (elevation, slope, curvature, proximity to rivers/roads, lithology, soil, etc.) and applies an advanced ANN model with attention mechanisms and residual blocks to predict landslide susceptibility. Features include: automatic raster processing and alignment, memory-efficient chunk-based processing for large datasets, integration with QGIS raster layer management, customizable prediction thresholds, and automatic map visualization. The output is a continuous susceptibility map showing areas of varying landslide risk, essential for hazard assessment, land use planning, and risk management.
